# quick_cataloguer
This is a down-and-very-dirty image cataloguing program.  End-users define their own tags and store them in a .txt file.  The rest is explained in the quick_cat_howto.pdf
The point is to enable quick cataloguing and searching of records for the fun of it ... and then link to other standards like LCSH, VRA4, whatever ... 
cheers.
